## Backlog (Architecture-Neutral)

| ID | Title | Priority | Package | Notes |
|----|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| B-026 | Replace `ONEDRIVE_TEST_DRIVE_ID` env var with typed discovery | P3 | CI + tests | CI could use a typed Go helper instead of the bootstrap tool to discover the drive ID. |
| B-030 | Review whether `internal/graph/` should be split | P2 | `internal/graph/` | Package has ~15 files. Assess cohesion vs. size. |
| B-033 | Implement accounts.md features | P1 | all | Setup wizard, `drive add`/`drive remove`, fuzzy `--drive` matching, RPC for `sync --watch`, email change detection, `service install`/`uninstall`/`status`, `status` command, `--account` flag, text-level config manipulation, commented-out config defaults on first login. |
| B-034 | Add --json support for login, logout, drive add/remove | P2 | root | These commands output plain text only. Per accounts.md §9, login should emit JSON events. |
| B-035 | Add --quiet support for login, logout, whoami, status, drive | P2 | root | Auth/drive commands write to stdout via `fmt.Printf`. File ops use `statusf()` which respects --quiet. Standardize all commands. |
| B-036 | Extract CLI service layer for testability | P2 | root | Root package at 28.1% coverage. All RunE handlers are untested. Need to extract pure logic from I/O for mock-based testing. Target: 50%+ coverage. |
| B-020 | SharePoint lock check before upload (HTTP 423) | P2 | `internal/graph/` | Check lock status before uploading to SharePoint. Avoid overwriting co-authored documents. |
| B-021 | Hash fallback chain for missing hashes | P2 | `internal/graph/` | Some Business/SharePoint files lack any hash. Fall back: QuickXorHash -> SHA256 -> size+eTag+mtime. |
| B-023 | `/children` fallback when delta incomplete | P3 | `internal/graph/` | National Cloud Deployments don't support `/delta`. Implement `/children` traversal fallback. |
| B-007 | Cross-drive DriveID handling for shared/remote items | P3 | `internal/graph/` | Verify against real API responses in E2E CI. |
| B-008 | Spec inconsistency: chunk_size units (MB vs MiB) | P2 | `docs/design/` | configuration.md says "10MB" default but requires 320 KiB multiples. Clarify spec. |
| B-031 | Profile and optimize performance | P3 | all | After feature-complete: CPU/memory/I/O profiling with `pprof`. |
| B-032 | Like-for-like performance benchmarks vs rclone and abraunegg | P3 | benchmarks | Reproducible benchmark suite comparing sync performance. |
| B-060 | Add `ResolveDrives()` for multi-drive sync | P1 | `internal/config/` | `ResolveDrive()` returns one drive. `sync` (all enabled) and `sync --drive a --drive b` need `ResolveDrives()` returning `[]*ResolvedDrive`. Required for 4v2.7 engine wiring. |
| B-061 | Shared `graph.Client` per token file for multi-drive | P2 | `internal/sync/` | Multiple drives sharing an account (business + SharePoint) should share one `graph.Client` (same token, same rate limit tracking). Engine wiring (4v2.7) should create one Client per unique token path, not per drive. |
| B-062 | Global worker pool cap for multi-drive sync | P2 | `internal/sync/` | Per-drive pools (8 dl + 8 ul + 8 hash) multiply with concurrent drives. 5 drives = 120 I/O goroutines. Need global cap or per-drive reduction when multiple drives active. Decision for 4v2.6 (executor) or 4v2.7 (engine wiring). |
| B-063 | Per-tenant rate limit coordination | P3 | `internal/graph/` | Multiple drives under same tenant share Graph API rate limits. Current per-client 429 retry works but isn't optimal. Shared rate limiter per-tenant would be better. Not critical for MVP. |
| B-064 | Baseline memory scaling for many drives | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Each drive loads full baseline into memory (~19 MB per 100K files). Additive across drives. 5 drives × 100K = ~95 MB baselines alone. Monitor during profiling (B-031). Lazy loading if needed. Also profile DepTracker memory alongside baseline (~12 MB tracker + ~20 MB actions per 100K files). |
| B-086 | Conflict notification for watch mode | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Phase 5: auto-resolved conflicts should emit events (structured log, desktop notification). |
| B-087 | Conflict retention/pruning policy | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Resolved conflicts accumulate forever. Add configurable retention (e.g., 90 days) with periodic pruning in Commit(). |
| B-071 | ConflictRecord missing Name field | P3 | `internal/sync/` | UX convenience for conflict reporting. `path.Base(Path)` suffices but Name from the PathView is cleaner. |
| B-074 | Drive identity verification at Engine startup | P2 | `internal/sync/` | Engine (4v2.7) should verify that the configured `driveid.ID` matches the API-reported drive ID at sync start. Catches stale config, renamed drives, or ID format changes. |
| B-085 | Resumable downloads (Range header) | P2 | `internal/graph/`, `internal/sync/` | Interrupted downloads restart from byte 0. Keep `.partial` file, send `Range: bytes=<size>-` on retry, append, hash-verify after completion. Matters for large files on slow connections — without this, Ctrl-C + re-sync restarts multi-GB downloads. Upload sessions already have resume via `QueryUploadSession`. |
| B-088 | Configurable auto-delete of OS junk files (.DS_Store etc.) | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Add configurable option to automatically delete OS-generated junk files during sync (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `._*` resource forks). Requires research: enumerate all common OS/editor/IDE junk filenames across macOS, Windows, Linux. Consider whether to delete locally, remotely, or both. May overlap with existing always-excluded filter patterns — evaluate unifying into a single configurable exclusion/cleanup system. Reference: `.gitignore` templates, rclone `--delete-excluded`, rsync filter rules. |
| B-092 | Audit and clean up unused schema tables | P2 | `internal/sync/` | Phase 5.4 final cleanup: `stale_files`, `config_snapshots`, `change_journal` tables exist in `00001_initial_schema.sql` but are never referenced in production code. They were forward declarations from the data-model spec. Determine whether to keep (if future features need them) or drop via `00003_cleanup.sql`. Also verify `upload_sessions` table was dropped in `00002_action_queue.sql` (subsumed by ledger). |
| B-093 | Configurable DepTracker lane routing threshold | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `DepTracker.dispatch()` uses a hardcoded 10 MB size threshold to route actions to interactive vs bulk channels. Make this configurable (e.g., via `EngineConfig` or TOML `bulk_threshold`). Useful for tuning on slow connections where smaller files should still use bulk lanes, or fast SSDs where the threshold can be higher. |
| B-094 | Configurable worker pool size | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `WorkerPool.Start()` uses `runtime.NumCPU()` as total worker count. Make this configurable per-drive (e.g., TOML `max_workers`). Related to B-062 (global cap for multi-drive) — per-drive config is the building block for global coordination. |
| B-096 | Parallel hashing in FullScan | P2 | `internal/sync/` | `FullScan()` hashes files sequentially in the `filepath.WalkDir` callback. For initial syncs of large trees with no baseline (mtime fast-path miss), this is the #1 performance bottleneck. Fix: walk runs sequentially as today (readdir+Lstat is I/O-serialized at hardware level, parallel readdir doesn't help), then fan out hash jobs to `errgroup.SetLimit(runtime.NumCPU())`. Walk populates `observed` map and collects `[]hashJob` for files needing hashes. Hash pool processes jobs, results assembled into events. Deletion detection runs after pool drains. ~30 lines of change, zero architectural impact. Phase 5.2.1. |
| B-097 | Ledger compaction for long-running watch mode | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Completed actions (`status='done'`) stay in `action_queue` indefinitely. In watch mode (5.2+), the table grows without bound. Add periodic `DELETE FROM action_queue WHERE status IN ('done','canceled') AND completed_at < ?` with configurable retention (default 90 days). Related: B-087 (conflict retention). |
| B-098 | ~~Backpressure handling for LocalObserver.Watch() event channel~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. Non-blocking `trySend()` with drop-and-log. Safety scan provides eventual consistency for dropped events. |
| B-099 | Configurable safety scan interval for Watch() | P2 | `internal/sync/` | `safetyScanInterval` is hardcoded at 5 minutes. Too aggressive for large trees (full `FullScan()` walks + hashes entire tree). Should be configurable via `EngineConfig` / TOML `safety_scan_interval`. Consider default 30 min for large drives, keep 5 min option for small drives. |
| B-100 | ~~Scan new directory contents on watch create event~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. `scanNewDirectory()` walks new directories after `watcher.Add()`, emitting events for pre-existing files. Recursive for nested subdirectories. |
| B-101 | Add timing and resource logging to safety scan | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `runSafetyScan()` only logs Debug entry/exit with event count. Add elapsed time, files walked, and directories scanned to the completion log line so operators can assess safety scan cost and tune the interval. |
| B-102 | ~~Hash failure silently drops events~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. All hash failure paths now emit events with empty hash instead of dropping: `handleCreate`, `scanNewDirectory`, `buildCreateEvent` (create paths), `handleWrite`, `classifyFileChange` (modify paths). Removed vestigial error return from `buildCreateEvent`. |
| B-103 | ~~`debounceLoop` final drain can deadlock~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Phase 5.2. Non-blocking select on final drain. |
| B-105 | `addWatchesRecursive` has no aggregate failure reporting | P3 | `internal/sync/` | If many directories fail to watch (e.g., permissions), each failure logs individually at Warn. No summary. A counter + single log line ("added watches on N/M directories, K failed") at the end would make diagnostics much easier. |
| B-106 | `timeSleep` duplicated across two packages | P3 | `internal/sync/`, `internal/graph/` | **Partially fixed** — `timeSleepExec` in `executor.go` consolidated to `timeSleep` in `observer_remote.go` (same package). Cross-package duplicate in `graph/client.go` remains — not worth a shared utility package for 6 lines. |
| B-107 | Write event coalescing at observer level | P2 | `internal/sync/` | `handleWrite` computes a full QuickXorHash on every fsnotify Write event. Rapid saves (e.g., editor auto-save) trigger multiple redundant hash computations. A small per-path cooldown (e.g., 100ms) before hashing would eliminate wasted I/O. The buffer debounce helps downstream but the observer still does expensive work. Separate from B-096 (FullScan parallel hashing) — this is a watch-mode concern. Address during Phase 5.2.2 (RunWatch) when the watch event loop is wired into the engine. |
| B-108 | No test for combined chmod+create fsnotify event | P3 | `internal/sync/` | On macOS, FSEvents sometimes delivers `Chmod\|Create` together. The filter at `handleFsEvent` correctly passes this through (ignores pure chmod only), but there's no test exercising this path. Add a test with a mock watcher sending combined event ops. |
| B-109 | ~~`RemoteObserver.Watch()` missing interval validation~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. Intervals below `minPollInterval` (30s) clamped with Warn log. Prevents tight polling loops. |
| B-111 | ~~Multiple `FlushDebounced()` calls silently break first goroutine~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. `FlushDebounced` now panics with clear message if called twice on the same Buffer. |
| B-112 | ~~`handleDelete` doesn't remove watches for deleted directories~~ | ~~P3~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. `handleDelete` now receives watcher + syncRoot, calls `watcher.Remove()` for deleted directories. |
| B-113 | ~~`Watch()` doesn't detect sync root deletion~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. `watchLoop` checks `syncRootExists()` after watcher errors and before safety scans. Returns `ErrSyncRootDeleted` sentinel. |
| B-114 | Event channel sizing undocumented in Watch() API | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `Watch()` receives `events chan<- ChangeEvent` but the API doesn't document whether it should be buffered or how large. An unbuffered channel blocks on every event. Ties into B-098 (backpressure) but is also a documentation/API-contract gap. |
| B-115 | Test: safety scan + watch producing conflicting change types for same path | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Watch sees a Create, safety scan 5 min later classifies same file as Modify (because Create was already committed to baseline). Buffer groups both under the same path — planner sees Create + Modify. Planner handles this (latest event wins), but it's an implicit contract with no dedicated test. Add an integration-style test covering this scenario. |
| B-116 | Document stale baseline interaction during watch mode | P2 | `internal/sync/` | In watch mode, `handleWrite` reads the live baseline (RWMutex-protected, sees incremental updates from executor). But `runSafetyScan` also reads the live baseline. If an action is in-flight (committed to ledger, not yet to baseline), the safety scan re-emits an event for something already being processed. Not a bug (idempotent), but the planner in Phase 5.2 needs to deduplicate against in-flight tracker actions. Document this interaction and add a test in 5.2 wiring. |
| B-117 | Test: transient file (create then immediate delete) on macOS | P3 | `internal/sync/` | macOS kqueue can coalesce rapid events. A Create followed immediately by Remove might arrive as just Remove. `handleDelete` emits a delete for something never seen as created. Baseline has no entry, so `itemType` defaults to `ItemTypeFile`. Planner should no-op on delete for non-existent path. Add a test to verify this doesn't cause errors. |
| B-118 | Test: local move produces out-of-order Rename+Create events | P3 | `internal/sync/` | A local `mv file.txt dir/file.txt` produces fsnotify Rename (delete at old path) + Create (at new path). If events arrive out of order (Create before Rename), the buffer sees Create at new path before Delete at old path. Planner handles both paths independently — verify this works correctly with a test using a mock watcher with reversed event order. |
| B-119 | Hashing actively-written files produces inconsistent state | P2 | `internal/sync/` | `handleWrite` hashes a file that may still be written to. The hash is for a partial/inconsistent state. Next Write event re-hashes, but if the file is large the hash takes seconds during which contents keep changing. The resulting hash matches nothing on either side. Upload reads yet another version. Eventually converges, but wastes bandwidth. Consider: retry hash after short delay, or compare size before/after hash to detect mid-write. |
| B-120 | Symlinked directories in sync root get no watch and no warning | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `addWatchesRecursive` uses `filepath.WalkDir` which doesn't follow symlinks. `FullScan()` also skips symlinks. Consistent behavior, but if a user symlinks a directory into their sync root expecting it to sync, nothing happens silently. Should log a Warn when a symlinked directory is encountered during watch setup. |
| B-121 | ~~Delta token and baseline are not atomically consistent~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Phase 5.2. Per-cycle completion tracking via `cycleTracker`. Delta token committed only after all cycle actions succeed. |
| B-122 | ~~No deduplication between planner output and in-flight tracker actions~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Phase 5.2. `HasInFlight(path)` + `CancelByPath()` in `processBatch()`. |
| B-123 | Repeated failure suppression missing for watch mode | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Persistent failures (size, permissions, corruption) trigger retries every safety scan and debounce cycle. Wastes CPU, bandwidth, and I/O continuously in a long-running daemon. Needs backoff or "skip after N failures" suppression logic. |
| B-124 | ~~Watch() error semantics don't distinguish exit reasons~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **CLOSED** — Investigated: asymmetry is harmless. Both observers return `nil` only on ctx cancel (expected). RemoteObserver retries indefinitely; LocalObserver surfaces genuine failures (nosync guard, watcher creation) as non-nil errors. Dead-observer detection handles both cases. Added clarifying comment in engine.go. |
| B-125 | No health or liveness signal from Watch() goroutines | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Engine starts `Watch()` in goroutines but can't detect if they are healthy, stuck on a channel, or silently dead. Needs heartbeat callback or periodic liveness signal to detect/restart stuck observers. |
| B-126 | ~~Buffer has no size cap~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. Buffer has `maxPaths` field (default 100K). New paths rejected at capacity with Warn log. Existing paths always accepted. Safety scan provides eventual consistency. |
| B-127 | No observer-level metrics or counters | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Observers lack counters for events produced, polls, hashes, or dropped fsnotify events. Essential for monitoring and diagnosing degradation in a daemon running for months. Distinct from B-101 (timing). |
| B-128 | Debounce semantics change under load | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `FlushDebounced` output channel has buffer 1. When consumer is busy, debounce blocks on send and the timer stops running. System degrades from "flush N ms after last event" to "flush as fast as consumer can process." |
| B-129 | ~~LocalObserver.Watch() has no backoff for watcher errors~~ | ~~P2~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. Exponential backoff (1s→30s, ×2) on watcher errors. Resets on successful event. Prevents tight log-spam loops. |
| B-130 | FsWatcher interface leaks fsnotify dependency through event type | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `Events()` returns `fsnotify.Event`, coupling tests/mocks to fsnotify types. Should use an abstract event type (path + operation enum) to isolate the dependency and clean up the abstraction boundary. |
| B-135 | Promote `fsnotify` to direct dependency in `go.mod` | P2 | root | `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` is directly imported in `observer_local.go` but listed as `// indirect` in `go.mod`. If the transitive dependency changes, fsnotify could silently disappear. Fix: `go get github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify@v1.9.0`. |
| B-136 | Run `go mod tidy` to drop unused `golang.org/x/sync` | P2 | root | `golang.org/x/sync` was used by `executeParallel()` (deleted in Phase 5.0). Still in `go.mod` as indirect. `go mod tidy` should remove it. |
| B-137 | Validate `sync_dir` for path traversal at config load | P3 | `internal/config/` | Config-supplied paths (`sync_dir`, future `sync_paths`) used for filesystem ops without `..` or symlink-escape validation. Low risk (user-controlled config) but `filepath.Clean` + `filepath.Abs` guard at config load time would be consistent with defensive coding principles. |
| B-138 | Add upstream sync check for oauth2 fork | P3 | CI | `tonimelisma/oauth2` fork will silently fall behind upstream security patches. Add periodic `go list -m -u` check in CI, or document sync process in `CLAUDE.md` next to the replace directive. |
| B-139 | Use `http.Status*` constants in `classifyStatusCode` | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `classifyStatusCode` uses raw integers (`401`, `507`, `408`, etc.) with `//nolint:mnd`. `http.StatusUnauthorized`, `http.StatusInsufficientStorage`, etc. would eliminate nolint and be self-documenting. |
| B-140 | Set `Websocket: false` default until feature is implemented | P2 | `internal/config/` | `defaults.go` sets `Websocket: true` but websocket mode is "Future (Post-v1)". Defaulting unimplemented feature to `true` is misleading. Same for `UseRecycleBin` and `UseLocalTrash` which are `true` but not wired into executor delete logic. |
| B-142 | Remove dead `truncateToSeconds` function | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `truncateToSeconds` in `observer_local.go:784` is defined but never called in production or test code. |
| B-143 | ~~Remove or ticket-ref `addMoveTargetDep` dead code~~ | ~~P3~~ | `internal/sync/` | **FIXED** — Watch hardening. `addMoveTargetDep` function and its call site removed from `planner.go`. |
| B-145 | Add `ledger.go`/`tracker.go` API documentation | P3 | `internal/sync/` | New Phase 5.0 components with no counterpart in `docs/design/`. `concurrent-execution.md` specifies them at high level but doesn't serve as API reference. File-level package comments documenting API contracts would suffice. |
| B-146 | `shutdownCallbackServer`: inject logger instead of `slog.Default()` | P3 | `internal/graph/` | `auth.go:299` uses global logger. |
| B-147 | `bootstrapLogger`/`buildLogger`: extract shared construction logic | P3 | root | `root.go:158-213` — overlapping logic. |
| B-148 | `deduplicateItems`: replace reverse-iterate-delete with forward-pass map | P3 | `internal/graph/` | `normalize.go:80-124`. |
| B-149 | Deduplicate conflict scan logic in `baseline.go` | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `scanConflictRow`/`scanConflictRowSingle` — 80 lines duplicated. |
| B-150 | Constrain `ConflictType`/`ResolutionStrategy` with validation function | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Unconstrained string aliases. |
| B-151 | `parseTimestamp`: use `time.Unix(0,0)` sentinel instead of `time.Now()` | P3 | `internal/graph/` | Non-deterministic fallback. |
| B-152 | `checkTokenState`: use lighter token-read helper instead of full `graph.Client` | P3 | root | `status.go:158-187`. |
| B-153 | Document hash-verify skip in `resolveTransfer` conflict resolution | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `engine.go:392-420`. |
| B-154 | Sort map keys in planner for reproducible action order | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Non-deterministic map iteration aids debugging. |
| B-155 | Conflict copy timestamp: use nanosecond precision | P3 | `internal/sync/` | 1s precision → ambiguous for same-second conflicts. |
| B-156 | `rm` command: warn that folder deletion is recursive | P2 | root | `files.go:367-400` — silent recursive delete. |
| B-157 | Add `conflicts --path <path>` filter for per-path conflict history | P3 | root | Only most recent conflict surfaced per path. |
| B-158 | `DownloadURL`: implement `slog.LogValuer` for compile-time redaction | P3 | `internal/graph/` | "NEVER log" is convention-only. |
| B-159 | `doOnce`: document implicit `Content-Type: application/json` default | P3 | `internal/graph/` | Undocumented assumption. |
| B-160 | Drop or document `conflicts.history` column | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Unused column in schema. |
| B-161 | Add SQL comment for `action_queue.depends_on` encoding | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Planner indices, not ledger IDs. |
| B-162 | Add `created_at` column to `action_queue` | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Aids watch mode debugging. |
| B-163 | Add `goose Down` rollback section to migration 00001 | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Only migration without rollback. |
| B-164 | Parallelize `discoverAccount` API calls | P2 | root | Three sequential independent calls (Me, Org, Drives). |
| B-165 | Implement local trash support for sync deletes | P2 | `internal/sync/` | Move deleted local files to OS trash instead of permanent delete. macOS: `~/.Trash/`, Linux: opt-in. |
| B-166 | Add `recycle-bin list` command | P3 | root, `internal/graph/` | Show OneDrive recycle bin contents. |
| B-167 | Add `recycle-bin empty` command | P3 | root, `internal/graph/` | Permanently delete all recycle bin items. |
| B-168 | Add `recycle-bin restore` command | P3 | root, `internal/graph/` | Restore items from recycle bin. |
| B-169 | Wire `UseRecycleBin: false` for permanent remote deletion | P3 | `internal/sync/` | When disabled, sync executor calls `PermanentDeleteItem` instead of `DeleteItem`. Business/SharePoint only. |
| B-170 | Parallel remote + local observation in RunOnce | P2 | `internal/sync/` | Steps 2 (remote delta) and 3 (local scan) in `RunOnce()` are sequential but independent — both read baseline in read-only mode. Use `errgroup.Go()` to run concurrently. Halves observation time for bidirectional sync. Easy win for Phase 5.2. |
| B-171 | Streaming delta processing (process pages as they arrive) | P3 | `internal/sync/` | `FullDelta()` accumulates all delta pages into `[]ChangeEvent` before returning. Process each page as it arrives — feed events into the buffer while fetching the next page. Reduces memory pressure and improves time-to-first-action for large deltas (thousands of remote changes). Deferred: page processing is ~1ms (path materialization, baseline lookup) vs ~100-300ms API call per page — overlap saves ~1ms per page. Modest win. Revisit when profiling shows it matters. |
| B-172 | SQLite batched commits for high-throughput workloads | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Every per-action `CommitOutcome()` is a separate SQLite transaction via sole-writer `SetMaxOpenConns(1)`. For high-throughput workloads (many small files), commit latency becomes the ceiling. Accumulate N completed actions and commit in one transaction. Trades crash-recovery granularity for throughput. Deferred: per-action commit is ~0.5ms in WAL mode. The bottleneck is network I/O (uploads/downloads), not SQLite. Batching also breaks the current contract where `tracker.Complete()` is called after commit succeeds. Revisit when profiling shows SQLite is the ceiling. |
| B-173 | Concurrent folder creates via Graph API `$batch` | P3 | `internal/graph/` | Nested folder hierarchies are serialized by parent→child DAG edges. But sibling folders at the same depth level could be created concurrently via Graph API `$batch` requests (up to 20 operations per batch). Reduces round-trips significantly for deeply nested initial syncs. Deferred: diminishing returns after first sync. Keep P3 until profiling shows folder creation is a bottleneck. |
| B-174 | Adaptive concurrency (AIMD worker scaling) | P3 | `internal/sync/` | AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) auto-tuning based on error rates and throughput. High 429 rate → halve active workers. Low error rate + high throughput → add one worker. Many small files → increase workers. Few large files → decrease workers. Designed in `concurrent-execution.md` §8, not implemented. |
| B-175 | Bounded DepTracker with ledger spillover | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Currently tracker channels are unbounded (sized to `len(plan.Actions)`). For watch mode with large change sets, this grows without bound. Design in `concurrent-execution.md` §10: cap tracker at 10K actions, refill loop loads more from ledger when capacity drops below 50%. Memory budget: ~5 MB for tracker vs unbounded today. |
| B-176 | WebSocket push remote observer (replace delta polling) | P3 | `internal/sync/` | Replace periodic delta polling with Graph API change notifications (WebSocket push). Eliminates polling latency entirely — changes arrive in near-real-time. Polling architecture is designed so switching requires changing only the trigger mechanism. Post-v1. |
| B-182 | Integration test for crash recovery (claimed → pending reclaim) | P2 | `internal/sync/` | Tracker is ephemeral per-cycle, so crash recovery must be handled at the engine/ledger level. When watch mode starts, query for stale `claimed` rows in `action_queue` and reset to `pending`. Add integration test: insert claimed rows with old timestamps, start new cycle, verify they're reclaimed and re-executed. Phase 5.3 (watch mode hardening). |
| B-183 | `purgeSingleDrive` ignores StateDir override | P2 | root | `purgeSingleDrive` uses `config.DriveStatePath()` which returns default state path, not the per-drive `state_dir` override from the TOML section. Requires threading `ResolvedDrive.StatePath()` through the purge flow. |

| B-059 | Implement Phase 4v2.2: Remote Observer | **Done** — PR #80. observer_remote.go, 23 tests, 86.4% coverage. |
| B-065 | Implement Phase 4v2.3: Local Observer | **Done** — PR #82. observer_local.go (FullScan, name validation, always-excluded, QuickXorHash), 31 tests with real temp dirs, 87.7% coverage. |
| B-066 | Implement Phase 4v2.4: Change Buffer | **Done** — PR #84. buffer.go (thread-safe Add/AddAll/FlushImmediate, move dual-keying), 14 tests with race detector, 91.2% coverage. |
| B-067 | Implement Phase 4v2.5: Planner | **Done** — PR #85. planner.go (5-step pipeline, EF1-EF14 + ED1-ED8 decision matrices, move detection, big-delete safety), 43 tests, 91.2% coverage. |
| B-073 | DriveTokenPath/DriveStatePath should accept `driveid.CanonicalID` | **Done** — Both functions now accept `driveid.CanonicalID`. All callers migrated: `auth.go` helper chain (`discoverAccount`, `findTokenFallback`, `canonicalIDForToken`, `purgeSingleDrive`), `files.go`, `status.go`, `drive.go`, `integration_test.go`. |
| B-068 | Executor must fill zero DriveID for new local items | **Done** — PR #90. `resolveDriveID()` fills zero DriveID from executor's per-drive context. |
| B-070 | Add ParentID to Action struct | **Closed (by design)** — PR #90. Executor resolves parent IDs dynamically via `resolveParentID()` chain: createdFolders → baseline → "root". No need to add ParentID to Action. |
| B-052 | Re-enable E2E tests in CI | **Done** — 4v2.8. E2E test block uncommented in `integration.yml`. |
| B-058 | Re-enable sync E2E tests in CI after Increment 8 | **Done** — 4v2.8. Sync E2E tests written (`e2e/sync_e2e_test.go`), CI re-enabled. Interactive resolve deferred to Phase 5. |
| B-075 | Upload session leak in chunkedUpload | **Done** — Hardening. `CreateUploadSession` succeeded but `os.Open`/`uploadChunks` failure paths never canceled the session. Added `CancelUploadSession` to `TransferClient`, `cancelSession` helper, regression test. |
| B-076 | Partial file leak on f.Close() failure | **Done** — Hardening. `downloadToPartial` left `.partial` file on disk if `f.Close()` failed after successful download. Added `os.Remove(partialPath)` in Close error path. |
| B-077 | resolveTransfer nil-map panic for conflicts resolved outside Execute() | **Done** — Hardening. `executor.baseline` and `executor.createdFolders` were uninitialized when `resolveTransfer` was called from `ResolveConflict` without a prior `Execute()`. Added lazy initialization guard. |
| B-078 | TransferClient leaks upload session lifecycle to consumers | **Done** — Refactor. `TransferClient` (5 methods) replaced with `Downloader` (1) + `Uploader` (1). Upload session lifecycle (create/chunk/cancel) encapsulated in `graph.Client.Upload()`. Removed ~170 lines of duplicated state machine code from Executor and CLI. |
| B-079 | Executor conflates immutable config with per-call mutable state | **Done** — Refactor. Split `Executor` into immutable `ExecutorConfig` + ephemeral `Executor` created per `Execute()` call via `NewExecution()`. Eliminates nil-map panics and temporal coupling. Phase 5 thread-safe. |
| B-080 | Upload progress callback was nil in executeUpload | **Done** — Hardening. `executeUpload` passed `nil` for progress callback. Added per-upload Debug-level closure with path context. |
| B-081 | Simple upload doesn't preserve mtime | **Done** — Hardening. Graph API simple upload (PUT /content) can't include `fileSystemInfo`. Added `UpdateFileSystemInfo()` PATCH method, called after simple upload when mtime is non-zero. |
| B-082 | Baseline Load() queries DB on every call | **Done** — Hardening. `resolveTransfer` called `Load()` per conflict, loading full baseline N times for N conflicts. Added cache-through pattern: `Load()` returns cached `*Baseline` if available, `Commit()` invalidates and refreshes. |
| B-083 | engineMockClient lacks compile-time interface checks | **Done** — Hardening. Added `var _ Interface = (*engineMockClient)(nil)` for all 4 interfaces + design comment. |
| B-084 | EF9 edit-delete conflict fails silently (404 download loop) | **Done** — Auto-resolve: local edit wins, uploaded to re-create remote. Conflict recorded as auto-resolved in history. `conflicts --history` shows resolved conflicts. E2E tests updated. |
| B-089 | Baseline concurrent-safe incremental cache for per-action commits | **Done** — Phase 5.0. `Baseline` gains `sync.RWMutex` + locked accessors (`GetByPath`, `GetByID`, `Put`, `Delete`, `Len`, `ForEachPath`). All production code migrated. Maps remain public for test convenience. |
| B-090 | Eliminate `createdFolders` map — use incremental baseline instead | **Done** — Phase 5.0. `createdFolders` deleted. DAG edges guarantee parent folder `CommitOutcome` → `Put()` before child dispatch. `resolveParentID()` uses baseline-only lookup. |
| B-091 | `resolveTransfer()` calls batch `Commit()` — must migrate to `CommitOutcome()` | **Done** — Phase 5.0. `resolveTransfer()` calls `CommitOutcome(ctx, outcome, 0)`. `ledgerID=0` skips ledger status update for manual conflict resolution. |
| B-095 | DepTracker.byPath cleanup on action completion | **Done** — Phase 5.1. `Complete()` and `CancelByPath()` now delete `byPath` entries. Regression tests added. |
| B-037 | Add chunk upload retry for pre-auth URLs | **Done** — `doPreAuthRetry` method added to `graph.Client`. `UploadChunk` (`io.Reader` → `io.ReaderAt`), `CancelUploadSession`, `QueryUploadSession`, `downloadFromURL` all use it. Retro follow-ups: graph coverage recovered via decode-error test; baseline cache invalidation YAGNI; upload-then-PATCH purity confirmed correct. |
| B-069 | Handle locally-deleted folder with no remote delta event | **Done** — ED8 changed from ActionCleanup to ActionRemoteDelete. Both folder classifiers restructured with upfront mode filtering parallel to file path. |
| B-072 | ED1-ED8 missing folder-delete-to-remote (folder EF6) | **Done** — Fixed as part of B-069. ED8 now propagates local folder deletes to remote. |
| B-135 | Promote `fsnotify` from indirect to direct dependency | **Done** — `go mod tidy` promoted to direct. |
| B-136 | Run `go mod tidy` to drop unused `golang.org/x/sync` | **Done** — `go mod tidy` run. |
| B-139 | Use `http.Status*` constants in `classifyStatusCode` | **Done** — Replaced raw integers with `http.StatusUnauthorized`, `http.StatusInsufficientStorage`, etc. |
| B-140 | Set `Websocket: false` default until feature is implemented | **Done** — Changed to `false`. `UseLocalTrash` now platform-specific (macOS=true, Linux=false). |
| B-142 | Remove dead `truncateToSeconds` function | **Done** — Removed function and its test. |
| B-143 | Remove or ticket-ref `addMoveTargetDep` dead code | **Done** — Watch hardening. Function and call site fully removed from `planner.go`. |
| B-156 | `rm` command: warn that folder deletion is recursive | **Done** — Added `--recursive` (`-r`) flag required for folder deletion, `--permanent` flag for Business/SharePoint. |
| B-165 | Implement local trash support for sync deletes | **Done** — Injectable `trashFunc` on `ExecutorConfig`, macOS `~/.Trash/` implementation, fallback to `os.Remove` on error. |
| B-104 | `FlushImmediate()` logs Info on empty buffer | **Done** — Changed to Debug log level for empty buffer flush. |
| B-110 | `LocalObserver.sleepFunc` is dead code | **Done** — Removed `sleepFunc` field and initialization from `LocalObserver`. |
| B-131 | Fix `userAgent` to use binary version constant | **Done** — Added `userAgent` field to `Client` struct, wired binary `version` from callers. Removed hardcoded constant. |
| B-132 | Fix download hash mismatch infinite loop | **Done** — Hash-verification retry loop (3 attempts) around network retry. On exhaustion, accepts download with `remoteHash = localHash` to prevent baseline mismatch loop. |
| B-133 | Track conflict copies in conflicts table | **Done** — `deleteLocalFile` hash-mismatch branch returns `ActionConflict` with `ConflictEditDelete`. Baseline entry deleted for unresolved edit-delete conflicts. |
| B-134 | Populate `remote_mtime` in conflict records | **Done** — Added `RemoteMtime` field to `Outcome`, populated in download, conflict, and edit-delete paths. `commitConflict` stores actual value. |
| B-141 | Warn on unimplemented config fields | **Done** — `WarnUnimplemented()` logs Warn for non-default values of unimplemented fields. Wired into config loading. |
| B-144 | Update stale design docs post-Phase 5.0 | **Done** — Fixed `rjeczalik/notify` → `fsnotify/fsnotify` in 3 design docs. Annotated `upload_sessions` as dropped in migration 00002. |
| B-103 | `debounceLoop` final drain can deadlock | **Done** — Phase 5.2. Non-blocking select on final drain prevents goroutine leak when consumer stops reading. |
| B-121 | Delta token and baseline are not atomically consistent | **Done** — Phase 5.2. Per-cycle completion tracking via `cycleTracker`. Delta token committed only after all cycle actions succeed. |
| B-122 | No deduplication between planner output and in-flight tracker actions | **Done** — Phase 5.2. `HasInFlight(path)` + `CancelByPath()` in `processBatch()`. |
| B-177 | Canceled-context ledger leak in `failAndComplete` | **Done** — Watch hardening. `failAndComplete` now uses pool-level ctx instead of per-action `actionCtx`. Prevents silent `ledger.Fail` failure when `CancelByPath` cancels the action context. |
| B-178 | `events` channel never closed in `startObservers` | **Done** — Watch hardening. WaitGroup tracks observer goroutines; `close(events)` on completion lets bridge goroutine exit cleanly. |
| B-179 | No dead-observer detection in watch loop | **Done** — Watch hardening. `startObservers` returns observer count. Main loop decrements on each exit; returns error when all observers dead. |
| B-180 | Undocumented baseline/token safety invariants | **Done** — Watch hardening. Added inline comments documenting stale-baseline safety (RWMutex in-place update) and delta token monotonicity. |
| B-181 | Missing `DownloadOnly` observer skip test | **Done** — Watch hardening. Added `TestRunWatch_DownloadOnly_SkipsLocalObserver` mirroring the upload-only test. |
| B-102 | Hash failure silently drops events | **Done** — Watch hardening. All hash failure paths emit events with empty hash: creates (`handleCreate`, `scanNewDirectory`, `buildCreateEvent`) and modifies (`handleWrite`, `classifyFileChange`). Removed vestigial error return from `buildCreateEvent`. |
| B-111 | Multiple `FlushDebounced()` calls silently break first goroutine | **Done** — Watch hardening. `FlushDebounced` panics with clear message if called twice on the same Buffer. |
| B-112 | `handleDelete` doesn't remove watches for deleted directories | **Done** — Watch hardening. `handleDelete` receives watcher + syncRoot, calls `watcher.Remove()` for deleted directories. |
| B-113 | `Watch()` doesn't detect sync root deletion | **Done** — Watch hardening. `watchLoop` checks `syncRootExists()` after watcher errors and before safety scans. Returns `ErrSyncRootDeleted`. |
| B-126 | Buffer has no size cap | **Done** — Watch hardening. Buffer has `maxPaths` field (default 100K). New paths rejected at capacity with Warn. Safety scan provides eventual consistency. |
| B-183 | Dropped-event counter for `trySend` | **Done** — Watch hardening round 2. Added `atomic.Int64` counter + `DroppedEvents()` accessor on `LocalObserver`. Engine logs drops in `watchCycleCompletion`. |
| B-184 | Reset backoff on successful safety scan | **Done** — Watch hardening round 2. `errBackoff` now resets to `watchErrInitBackoff` after each safety scan tick, not just fsnotify events. |
| B-185 | Test `trySend` channel-full path | **Done** — Watch hardening round 2. Added `TestTrySend_ChannelFull_DropsEvent`, `TestTrySend_ChannelAvailable_SendsEvent`, `TestTrySend_ContextCanceled_NoDrop`. |
| B-186 | Test `scanNewDirectory` recursive depth | **Done** — Watch hardening round 2. Added `TestWatch_NewDirectoryNestedRecursion` (3-level dir tree, verifies all intermediate dirs and deep file detected). |
| B-187 | Split `observer_local.go` into two files | **Done** — Watch hardening round 2. Extracted `watchLoop`, event handlers, and `runSafetyScan` into `observer_local_handlers.go`. Main file: 591 lines, handlers: 335 lines. |
| B-188 | Split `observer_local_test.go` to mirror source split | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3. Moved Watch, trySend, and recursive scan tests to `observer_local_handlers_test.go`. Original: 1281 lines, new: 627 lines. |
| B-189 | Test backoff reset on safety scan | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3. Added `TestWatchLoop_BackoffResetsOnSafetyScan` and `TestWatchLoop_BackoffEscalatesWithoutReset`. Made `safetyScanOverride` and `sleepFunc` injectable on `LocalObserver`. |
| B-190 | Fix cumulative drop counter → per-cycle reset | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3. Added `ResetDroppedEvents()` using `atomic.Int64.Swap(0)`. Engine calls `ResetDroppedEvents()` instead of `DroppedEvents()` in `watchCycleCompletion`. |
| B-191 | Document intentional blocking sends in `RemoteObserver.Watch` | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3. Added comment explaining why remote delta events use blocking sends (no recovery mechanism for dropped events, unlike local safety scan). |
| B-192 | Document `timeSleep` cross-file dependency | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3. Made `LocalObserver.sleepFunc` injectable (matching `RemoteObserver` and `ExecutorConfig` patterns). Updated `timeSleep` doc comment to describe shared usage across all three consumers. |
| B-193 | Make `mockFsWatcher.Close()` idempotent | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3b. Added `sync.Once` to prevent panic on double-close of event/error channels. |
| B-194 | Make safety scan ticker injectable for deterministic tests | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3b. Added `safetyTickFunc` field to `LocalObserver` (same pattern as `sleepFunc` and `watcherFactory`). Eliminated `time.Sleep(300ms)` timing dependency in `TestWatchLoop_BackoffResetsOnSafetyScan`. |
| B-195 | Document `DroppedEvents()` and mock watcher `Add()` intent | **Done** — Watch hardening round 3b. Clarified `DroppedEvents()` is retained for tests/diagnostics (production uses `ResetDroppedEvents`). Documented mock `Add()` no-op behavior. |
