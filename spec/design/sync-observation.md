# Sync Observation

## Remote Observer (`observer_remote.go`)

Produces `[]ChangeEvent` from the Graph API. Two modes: `FullDelta` (one-shot) and `Watch` (continuous polling).

Key properties:
- Output is `[]ChangeEvent` — never writes to the database
- Path materialization uses the baseline (read-only) + in-flight parent tracking
- Normalization (driveId casing, missing fields, timestamps) happens here
- Within each delta page, deletions are buffered and processed before creations (API reordering bug)
- HTTP 410 (expired delta token) returns `ErrGone` sentinel; engine restarts with full delta

### Shortcut Observation (`observer_shortcut.go`)

Shared folder shortcuts require separate delta scopes. Personal drives use delta (shortcuts appear in the delta stream). Business drives use folder enumeration (no shortcut support in Business delta). Observation method recorded per-shortcut for correct dispatch.

## Local Observer (`observer_local.go`)

Produces `[]ChangeEvent` from the filesystem. Two modes: `FullScan` (one-shot walk) and `Watch` (inotify/FSEvents via `fsnotify/fsnotify`).

Key properties:
- Output is `[]ChangeEvent` — never writes to the database
- Local events keyed by path (no ItemID — that's a remote concept)
- Compares against in-memory baseline, not DB queries
- Racily-clean guard: same-second mtime triggers hash verification
- Dual-path threading: `fsRelPath` (filesystem I/O) and `dbRelPath` (NFC-normalized for baseline lookup)
- Symlinked directories always excluded from watch mode
- inotify watch limit detection on Linux (`inotify_linux.go`)

### Scanner (`scanner.go`)

Extracted filesystem walker for full-scan mode. Produces change events by walking the sync directory and comparing against baseline.

## Change Buffer (`buffer.go`)

Collects events from both observers, deduplicates, debounces (default 2 seconds), and produces `[]PathChanges` batches grouped by path. Thread-safe (mutex-protected). Move events are dual-keyed: stored at new path AND synthetic delete at old path.

`FlushImmediate` for one-shot mode (no debounce wait).

## Permissions (`permissions.go`)

Read-only detection for shared content. When a write attempt returns 403, the path prefix is recorded and subsequent writes to that prefix are suppressed (download-only for that subtree).
